Hey, sorry to message out of nowhere.. I saw you were texting Lena recently. I'm her roommate... Have you heard from her?

[[Not lately. Is something wrong?|Round-2.1]]

[[Yeah, we talked. Who are you?|Round-2.2]]

[[I barely know her.|Round-2.3]]


:: Round-2.1 [Jamie] {"position":"800,200","size":"100,100"}
She’s been gone two days. Didn’t take much—just her hoodie and phone. Didn’t say where she was going. She sometimes vanishes, but this feels off.


[[Why did you contact me?|Round-3.1]]

[[Did you try calling the cops?|Round-3.2]]

[[Who else was she close with?|Round-3.3]]

I’m Jamie—her roommate. I was checking her texts for any leads.  Sorry if that’s weird. I’m just worried.
